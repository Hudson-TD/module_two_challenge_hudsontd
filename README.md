Description:

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a portfolio website that will house our creations over the course of the bootcamp. In my approach I wanted to make an extremely responsive website that would look clean and correct across all of the most popular mobile devices and tablets. To accomplish this goal I implemented a lot of media queries and used a flexbox layout. I spent a lot of time changing my color scheme and background and by implementing root elements at the start this was quick and efficient. Due to not having any completed projects I used placeholders of the desired size. I plan to refactor my html and CSS in the future when I do have projects to display so that I can continue to improve and display my skills.
